"I returned from my summer vacation and it was really hard to step back to the work rhythm, directly experienced physical fatigue and difficulty working, even though I was doing all well at work.",0
"Well, a little tired but not strange.",0
"Health concerns (caused by injury) have burdened the mind and caused stress and money.My life is approaching the post -graduation intersection, so the openness of the future is in mind, both with hope and causing stress.I've spent a lot of time with friends and family, and it has given peace, happiness and enthusiasm.Sometimes I feel the right joy, hope and happiness.Sometimes I am tired and depressed about life's setbacks and insecurity.Sometimes you feel creative.I'm looking for peace of mind in the idea that life carries, even though I don't quite know what's next.",0
"In retirement, I set myself in a summer cottage for repair projects that make surprising difficulties and time end, even though I have not set precise milestones.All pilot projects all.",0
"I have been very stressed, I feel pressure at work even though the work has just started and, for the reasons I have not caused, I still can't do anything at work.Waiting for a project to start at work causes a lot of stress and nervousness.I constantly feel that I have to be doing something even though it is currently not possible.Nor have I really got my studies forward even though it would have had time to do them now.I find my overall well -being a bit bad at the moment, but not as bad I have sometimes had in similar situations.",0
"I've been on vacation and balance for almost 6 weeks.So I'm relaxed.The most challenging part was traveling with good friends.It is sometimes quite challenging, different when we are.",1
"I've been on a summer vacation, except for a couple of days when I had to do a work gig.I have been a little anxious and stressed about my work gig, and I am annoyed that I have to work in my summer vacation during my summer vacation.However, it has also been fun to spend the summer with family and friends.There has been some insomnia.",0
"I have been partially on vacation, and it has been a relaxed stay, seeing friends, etc. Returning to work has not caused much stress and the start of work has been very peaceful and there has been no hurry yet.The impending move is a little stressful.",1
Well I have been able to see what I am happy about because in previous summers my depression has recurred.,1
"Tired but accomplished.Last week was consuming, but at least I survived the vacation.",1
Health problems (chronic pain) overshadow and influence everything.It brings insecurity and depresses.,0
"Over the last two weeks, I have returned to work from a summer vacation and started to experience anxiety again.However, this is not directly due to my work, which I mainly enjoy, but I generally suspect that social situations bring it.The anxiety that started at the beginning of the corona time often falls on the surface from scratch, sometimes more and sometimes less of a sting",0
"Over the last two weeks I have received a lot of good news and have been happy about them.Normally I am quite smooth/happy, but the joyful news of three very good work, apartment and human relationships brought me close to me for a moment to a small bubble of happiness.Then I found out that my home might have beds and the bubble broke out.After the first day's shock and mild anxiety, I have shifted to action and a steady irritation of the subject.However, I believe that this irritation will subside within a couple of weeks and the process of fighting will begin.",1
Quite a lot of characterless anxiety.It's hard to get joy to things that are basically nice.,0
"I have experienced stress for the last two weeks.I have noticed that I am not very interested in what I am doing now, and I have tried to come up with ways to get emotionally dealing with it, or alternatively, to come up with something very creative so that interest will arouse.This has so far remained at the level of aspirations.In addition, I have been annoyed by a few ethical issues regarding what people have done and possibly do in the future.All this makes me feel very powerless, and so it would be better to just focus on doing what I do anyway anyway.Namely, I can't take great risks in my life right now.When I don't think of anything, my emotional state is neutral or even very 1.I will probably avoid challenges to get into that state more often that I don't have to think about anything.",0
Sometimes worry about health or financial situation.,0
"I felt quite good, with a life full of 1 inputs and experiences. I didn't have much time to relax, as the time was divided between family/friends/relationship and part-time work. I think remote working gave this valuable opportunity to change places, adjust the schedule more flexibly. At the same time, now more than ever, I almost never feel completely ""offline"". It is difficult to establish boundaries, as everything is fluid and confusingly together. You can work 5 minutes or 5 hours, anytime.",1
"The summer vacation was pleasing and I felt rested.I have planned my next semester studies carefully enough, so I'm ready for the future.",1
Completely satisfactorily.Summer vacation.Research progresses very slowly.No interesting news.I haven't met people just.Pretty relaxed.,1
"I'm really exhausted but at the same time motivated to work.I do too much overtime, but I want to do my job as well as possible.",0
"I have been well.I succeeded in projects that were challenging.However, some projects are still 'step' so that I'm not sure if I'm already helpful or can I still get a publication (book estimate).",1
"Because of the loved one, the last few weeks have been heavy.However, for the first time in a good state of life (health, education and work situation, place of education, residence), which has been a really stimulating experience, considering that the last 4-5 years have been worse or felt wrong or unpleasant (especially in the brackets).",1
"I sleep when it hurts, sometimes in the morning to three.Difficulty to go to bed makes me sleep only when I collapse.When you wake up, you feel horrible for many hours, though also because of your physical illness.It eats much of my day, so often a big part if not all the things I have planned are not done.This increases anxiety from non -impaired, even though there are good health reasons.I have actively watered the plants and indoors and outdoors, and I have found myself happy to notice something new.I am delighted, even if I have dragged myself by willpower to water the drying plants, and I enjoy watering everything in the yard for quite some time.Surprise mushrooms between the grass are one source of joy.After watering, I am more energetic than before, and more likely to do something other than just watching programs on the couch.",0
"I have felt lonely because I miss a partnership that I don't have.I've also been exhausted physically because I've traveled so much during the summer.Over the past 2 weeks, I have also experienced inspiration in my hobbies and studies and contact my friends.",0
Illness on the summer vacation has taken the head and made it difficult to make meaningful holiday plans,0
"Summer work has been very busy due to the staff shortage that has 0ly affected the quality of the work, and I have been sick for several days",0
"I returned from my vacation to work I have done on part-time and summers for several years, and I will leave in three weeks.I was really unmotivated even though my job is really motivating and interesting, and otherwise I feel bad.Evenings did some nice, restorative stuff with people, but I still felt heavy at the start of the working day.Usually and now I overcome the situation by being merciful to myself, relaxing and important to work properly short stretches, from which I was looking for little experiences of success",0
"The life situation has been particularly stressful for years.Work, hobbies and relationships give you strength, but at times (even in the last two weeks) is anxious, frustrated, depressed and sad.All in all, I feel that I do well on the ""over"", but internally I am really broken.",0
"For the first time in the last two weeks, I have been on a paid holiday for the first time in five years.Stress and life situations have been in a really good model",1
"I answered the questionnaire, but for me, exhaustion is caused by a 1 year old child who sleeps poorly.I do a half -day job of a doctoral researcher, but I still do poorly because of intermittent nights and work pressure.The relationship also suffers due to increased irritability.Korona, the war and, above all, the climate crisis combined with fresh motherhood and pressure to get the dissertation completed at the end of funding have not been an easy combination.My mood throws from briskly to perfect tiredness and Jacob's wrestling with myself whether I am tired or lazy and unreasonable.Sometimes I can be merciful to myself, sometimes not.It depends on how well the night has been sleeping the previous night.",0
"Over the past two weeks, I have experienced intense anxiety about the future and the financial situation.My income is already small already and they are decreasing so that they are no longer enough to cover my expenses (rent, water, electricity, bus ticket).This is tremendously anxious and makes me paralyzed.The change is not in sight even though I have worked hard to get a job and pay.",0
"I have been stressed because I am involved in many small projects, which results in the calendar.On the other hand I am praised for my everyday life and the things I can face there now",0
"Well, I've been on vacation.",1
"The life of a depression diagnosed human being is a gray mass that rarely distinguishes any light spots over any time span.Depression also has correlation with memory disorders, so it is questionable how well I would be able to remember anything different from my well -being, even for a period of two weeks.",0
"On vacation, a person is doing well.At least I have been able and adventured by myself, it brought joy.Unfortunately, a little bit of a partner got intimacy during a joint holiday, which annoys, but otherwise it goes well.(Summer vacation time may affect your answers)",1
The health of family members is currently concerned.Seeing friends and doing meaningful things has made it easier for it to feel sick and anxiety.The beginning of the new phase in studies is inspiring but exciting at the same time.,0
"I went to a scientific conference where our work was rewarded.This caused great pleasure.My supervisor invented to start a new project that Deadline is very soon, which causes a lot of stress.",1
"I've been tired but I'm tired of time except on vacation.It feels like there are a lot of things and feelings to deal with for mental well -being, but you don't have time.At the same time, however, I accept extra tasks even though I get tired.At work, I get a lot of freedom to do things at my own pace and the way I want, and it maintains working ability, can rest when you get too tired.I also receive appreciation (either real or imagined) from the work community.",0
