I have no idea!Personality question?,0
"It is worth giving up if: --A progress does not happen despite the hard attempt -the means of entertainment will prove to be more important than the goal, ie it has been decided how the goal should be achieved and that it is not revealed even if it is not a functioning target -it is worthwhile to continue its importance to its importanceIf: --sce is genuinely important to yourself and, for example, the pressure from the outside does not have a realistic route for the ""should"" view of the target still have a realistic route",1
How do I know what other people think.,0
"People give up when experiencing risks or losses are greater than possible benefits, or when the forces run out.Evaluation, on the other hand, is subjective, with different people evaluating and valuable situations, losses and benefits in different ways.",1
The degree of self -knowledge and self -portrait.,1
"Depends on a person.For my part, I often wonder if my ability is sufficient to pursue a goal and if the answer is positive I will not give up very easily.As such, it does not matter what other people think about whether I can do some people who can make the opinion of most people in the family and friends.",1
"When you know.There are so many goals.If the goal is important enough - like the promotion of a sustainable lifestyle - you should never give up.That is, the meaning of the goal is affected.The sub -goals also influence whether or not any progress is made.And then certainly you have to stop when you have your own power.",1
"If mental and physical resources are last, then at least you should take a break from the goal.However, I would never recommend giving up if the goal really is a great dream/dream for myself.",1
"Sufficientness of one's own resources and assistance of support networks, ability, perseverance, support from others",1
The opinions of the loved ones should be taken into account.,0
"Ktsy yourself is it really important or just ""vanity project"".",0
difficult question.I myself have been looking for the answer for probably 20 years.,0
"I don't know, but I would like to say ""when the whole thing takes more than it can give.""I often do not give up, and so far I have always survived the situations I have encountered or agreed;But on the other hand, life has not so far thrown me in insurmountable situations where surrender would now have been the most sensitive to the most sensible.",0
"If the pursuit creates significantly more stress and difficulties than the joy of achieving a potential head.The decision is influenced by one's own resources, the support provided by others and the importance of the mainstream.",1
"Talking with others helps to evaluate and relate things.By thinking about the decision, perhaps in a way, random ... how thoughts have happened.",1
"People do not know in any general level when it comes to giving up and when to continue pursuing goals. I think it is that from time to time it believes that some aspirations are particularly fatal. If the success of the effort affects the rest of your life, then maybe you should continue to pursue such a goal for the rest of life, if necessary. This can be experienced just as well in an emotional or rational way. I understand no one knows why a person ends up interested in certain things, or to build their identity in a certain way. In theory, the decision to surrender is influenced by depression, traumatization, injury, death or a reasonable threat of losing spirit. In practice, however, it is influenced by the willingness to remain in a constant state of stress during the pursuit of a goal, and the willingness to constantly take the risk that the goal is not achieved and nothing is available when time does not expect anyone. Certainly other things could be mentioned here too.",1
If the goal turns out to be impossible.,1
"Personally, I stop when I find out that my mental or physical health is suffering from dedicating time to something that is not giving me the results I expect or is not a goal that reflects my ideas anymore. Other people (family or close friends) can help me reflect on my health and decisions. I keep going or change strategy or adjust my goal if what I am doing makes sense to me and is significant for my life.",1
"It's a good idea to give up when you feel the financial, mental capital and/or other environmental benefits that come from the goal is lower in relation to your own physical and mental health.If you find a better way to go, or find a new goal, it is easier to justify the decision to give yourself and, if necessary, to others.",1
I really can't say that,0
"Give up when every other word choice is ""fuck"" and every other ""Satan"".",1
"There is no one 'right' answer to this.Some are unable to give up, but continue to be in danger of life.Good self -awareness and situational awareness will best help you give up when needed.",1
Depends on everything.,0
"If it is difficult to see all the small components, that is, all small steps that lead to a bigger goal, you may need to give up.Also, if your own and others' safety plus well -being (physical, financial) is threatened, you should not continue to pursue a goal.I think the decision to give up is most influenced by the first thing I mentioned, that is, whether the person in question is able to outline which small steps are towards a bigger goal.Also, your own morality and empathy for others are influenced (if you find that you risk others when aiming for the goal, this may have a lot to do with some).What also affects it is self-preservance Instinct, and what is not is more is much likel to put oneself at risk (Both Financial as well as socialally in terms of risking ""Making a fool"" of one fails at Target).",1
"I was wondering what happens after I gave up and possibly I make a plan in case I have to give up.In the studies, you really have to give up and don't decide to give up because time does not work with the course and your health.When achieving the goal no longer achieves what was really the reason for choosing the goal, it is good to give up.Sometimes you realize that something else is much more important.Otherwise, you will notice that you are trying the same thing over and over again, has been trapped to repeat yourself.In my opinion, noticing this requires that you want to notice it.",1
"My own motivation achieves the goal and the ability to compromise on the goal, for example, to switch it to another affecting the decision to give up.",1
Asking yourself if this matter matters on the death bed,0
does not know,0
The amount of the remaining challenges and the amount of work required,1
"Programming has the term ""Kill Your Children"", which describes a situation where you have used a lot of effort to build a particular thing and for one reason or another it is bad or otherwise needs to be removed or done in another way.In such a situation, the skill of letting go is important and is constantly evolving, as programming is essentially full of situations like the previous one.",1
An interesting question.The goals of their own core values are certainly sought even if success is unrealistic.The context is certainly influenced by the context: who is affected by the decision and how is I experienced after the surrender?,1
"If the pursuit of the matter causes prolonged pain, as a result, a decision to surrender arises.",1
Give it worth it if pursuit of a goal endangers something else that is vital to yourself like relationships or health,1
When it comes to pursuing it is no longer a pleasure.,1
"If the goal is very important to you, you should continue to pursue it.If there is nothing to lose, it is worthwhile to continue the pursuit until the goal achieves.The supply is certainly influenced by how likely it is to achieve the goal.Timed and monetary resources and their lack also affect the decision to surrender.",1
I believe that the surrender is due to despair about achieving a goal or in misconceptions of either one's own resources or the nature of the problem,1
When all the stones are turned and you can't do anything about it yourself.,1
"When they wake up to the fact that the creation (about figuratively, there is no gods) was a little sick joke.",1
Donation will probably be affected if a person does not notice any progress in his or her efforts.This will certainly calculate the motivation to continue.,1
"Yeah, I don't know.It depends on the person who feels impossible.",0
"When you have given your best yet couldn't achieve your goal and there are other factors that need to have priority like economic stability, family, kids, etc",1
Intuition or how well the matter encounters with one's own values.,1
"Quite a few people probably know, I believe that most are strongly experiencing ""Sunk Cost Fallacy"" and continue when it is good to give up.I believe that people give up when the belief that the goal can be achieved at all will end.",1
It is worth giving up when the merits of the goal no longer exceeds the resources used for its efforts.,1
"When the task begins to look impossible after many attempts, or too laborious in relation to the benefit it brings.When the task eats too much of the hectic resources/time.When the task that has already begun begins to look useless or Aija can be used for something more important.",1
