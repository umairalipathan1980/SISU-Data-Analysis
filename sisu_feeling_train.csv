"Really bad.I burned out and I have not recovered yet because I have never done the recovery process (= vacation).Cycling with a really bad thing.The challenge is the industry I have chosen, plus people.In the bad era of the moment, not terribly 1 events when you are challenging to have normal things.",0
"I have been able to vary in two weeks, the emotional states have changed from cheerful to sad, and I have been quite tired because of my work and my life.I resigned from a long relationship a month ago, and it has produced both sleep problems as well as general depression and anxiety.On the other hand, at the same time, on my work front, I have gained new challenges and new winds, and spent a lot of time with my loved ones.This has had a 1 impact on one's own well -being and also supported during a difficult time.",0
"I've been restful and calm.Occasionally, insomnia has occasionally hampered rest.I wake up early in the morning and I'm tired and tired in the morning hours.Nightmares have often been related to my profession.",0
"Quite varied due to the challenges of my personal life.However, the situation has been compensated for the beginning of the ""holiday"", that is, my studies ended and I do part-time work alone.",1
"Four days ago I returned my bachelor's thesis and it was very stressful and exciting.Since then, I've got a little relaxation and enjoyed the summer.A week ago, I was watching at night, taking care of the thesis.",1
I probably have a job for five people and it is difficult to refuse them because I have to grow CV and publish as much articles as possible because I am at the university and have to apply for funding all the time,0
It is difficult to believe that working life would never have anything 1 to offer.,0
"In general, I have been doing well and been happy.Much has happened in two weeks.I've seen a lot of friends and relatives, been at the party and planned for the future.I have done some overtime because I have missed hours from previous weeks.I may not have slept enough, but I know that since next week there will be more time.I graduated with a master's degree and agreed on work patterns.I have been proud of my studies and for daring to be myself.On the other hand, I have not been the most satisfied with my current work, mainly because of its one -sidedness and low salary.But this is not a big problem because the employment relationship is short -term.",1
"I've been over to overtime because I sometimes take a little too much work for myself when many things are interested.That's why I have probably suffered from difficulty falling asleep.My work is physically and sometimes mentally heavy and after work I have been tired.However, there are nice things happening in your spare time - band hobbies and friends keep your mind good.",0
"There is a hurry at work, but I try my best to not get stressed anyway.I am more worried about my somatic health.I am happy about my relationships and friends.",1
"Lots of important events (daughter's yo and entrance examinations, as well as the boy's graduation from elementary school and access to high school) and decisions (selling a summer cottage and buying an apartment) + own artistic work.Excitement, stress, feelings of happiness and gratitude.Concerns about their own well -being and mental well -being and the economy.",1
The work has been distressed.,0
"I have slept and have been rested in varying degrees.This has influenced my coping during the day at work and to get things done.I have worked a lot in the evenings and on weekends in my spare time to get my job done.However, this has been my choice.I want to do the job well and show my necessity.",1
Summer vacation so more free time and a nice program anyway.Life goes well.,1
I can't get rid of work even though I'm already on vacation.They spin in my head and in my dreams.There are also things in the messages that require a reaction.I am tired in a way I have never been before.,0
"""Summer vacation"" has brought a little relaxation to everyday life, so I feel better than during the school year.However, I still have less than a number of credits from the school year, so I try to force the dice in addition to work.Fortunately, I am in a supervision job that really has no job if everything goes well.",1
"Dreams were low due to an event of one week, where I was volunteering.Sleep deprivation immediately affects coping, and everything seems difficult.Communality was a stunning experience, and after a couple of rest days (12-14 hours), it is quite normal again.I heard that I had access to a field that is my passion, and I'm so excited.At the same time, it's excited to go to the school bench after a break of more than 10 years.There is a challenge in a relationship because of another illness, but we go day by day.All in all a good feeling, and feeling really good about the circumstances.I could be quite paralyzed.",0
I have been well.The work is meaningful and I can learn/improve my special expertise.,1
"I've been really anxious, depressed and tired.I find it difficult to focus on work or really anything.My insomnia is pretty much chronic: I never really sleep more than five hours a night and wake up many times in the middle of the night.",0
"I have been well.There are big solutions at work, but the top management has given them enough time and resources to do them.At the same time, I'm tense and excited.",1
"Occasionally, past events are disturbing me, even though they have been 8-10 years old.Poor self -esteem and experiencing loneliness.On the other hand, at home I can relax and enjoy music, online surfing and good food.Summer refreshes mood.",0
"Poor, because in a day it is not enough to do the work well, take care of the home (where the spouse just messes) and hobbies.The state of NATO membership in Finland is also constantly distressing and I am afraid of starting the war.I have been very stressed and tense and I consider the difference between the spouse and resignation every day, and move to a small cabin alone somewhere far from other people and the evil of the world.",0
"In teleworking, it is harder to remain scarp compared to working in the workplace.",0
I have been well.I have experienced work and studying stress at the same time and the future is distressing.I do not know what are important decisions for the future and I am afraid to make and choose wrong.,0
"Very.Current work gives you the opportunity to develop yourself, autonomy is great and the work is rewarding.There is no need to work all the way and the hours of work are human.",1
"For the past two weeks, I have been more tired than usual, but otherwise well -off.",0
"At the beginning of last week, I was stressed about time and livelihood, but the last few days have provided me with solutions and happy opportunities.",1
I've been quite stressed because of the new work and it has also caused a lot of fatigue,0
There is too much work at work and the work is cognitively and physically stressful.There are constantly in the work community and no common means of protecting them from them when you are the only one who uses the respirator.There is no occupational safety and health.People's irresponsibility burdens.,0
I have been able to vary.,1
"I've been doing well because I've been on vacation.Otherwise, I have a confidence in my life, because completing a higher education degree is only three courses and a graduation.After that, I start the company.",1
"On vacation, I can be excellent, I can be present for my children, eat healthy, sleep enough, I can focus on goal -oriented sports.Life feels worth living.",1
"Finishing and refunding the thesis has been exhausting in addition to work.I have been tired and anxious and falling asleep in the evenings, while in the mornings, waking up is sometimes insurmountable.For this reason, I have gone late to work and worked for a long time.1 success has been a personal success in leisure time, which is happy to surprise other people.",0
"Again, I have been disappointed with my doctoral thesis counselors and their communication ability, their desire to help me with the end of the dissertation process, their laziness to read messages and cultural differences. I feel physical feeling when I should do a doctoral dissertation, I need beta blockers, and my instructor wants to prolong the process and intend to sit on the texts for 7 weeks. I am delighted with my kids, but I am in pain and I can't be terribly constructive when they want to buy expensive pens and filling cartridges for over 30 euros after the promised hoplop trip, and yesterday they wanted some toys and the wish list already has expensive pens. I am disgusted with how little my spouse is interested in me and my news, and almost horrified at how a different picture he gives himself when he is the parent of the Parents' Association and what he is at home. I have experienced that I was left alone to survive everything without giving me resources and tools for it. I have often been hungry, and I have been disappointed with myself when I have not remembered to plan when I go to the grocery store and what we have to eat.",0
"I have been doing well, and there are a lot of wonderful things to come to me with me to look forward to;Best friend's birthday party, together with friends and among others.A migration with a boyfriend.From time to time, I have experienced low work motivation in the last couple of weeks, as my work is very time -time and there are few employees.Fortunately, I have been compensated for work motivation feelings by paying more attention to other aspects of life, and at the moment I get a lot of joy and strength from my relationships.",1
"Over the last two weeks, I have been doing well and has been accompanied by many 1 events and 1, exceeded challenges.During the winter and spring, I went through a very challenging phase with my supervisors and I thought I was treated unfairly and inappropriately, which still feels, even though fortunately the situation has improved between us after the discussion.At the moment, however, I am mainly happy with the situation, even though I do not easily feel that I can turn to my supervisors in difficult issues.Fortunately, there are other people in the workplace who have supported.",1
Better than before.The total load on work and studies has decreased.It is easy to focus solely on work and not by balance between studies and work.,1
"It's been a really busy week at my work and I've worked twice as much as normal.It has also just moved home by an impossibly active puppy that eats everything and requires a lot of attention.So there has been enough to do, but now it starts to make it easier.",0
"Teacher deputy, but teaching a full hourly employment contract signed from August.Ecstatic.",1
"Depressed, anxious, stressed.The school is not progressing, the work is numb and does not correspond to training in any way.Hrsnly maintained when no one is interested in communication",0
"Relatively well.The progress and clarification of things have brought new vigor and motivation to my work.I also managed to clean my home with thoroughly what motivates and clarifies my head.Yes, I have been very tired as the long graduation contract closes the end.I easily drop the goods and thinking has slowed down.My physical health has been quite smooth and I am not going to have a bad season right now.This also helps to cope with a lot of time, as weak physical health takes everyday life.",1
"Inu has had a small flu so part of the time has gone to recover.Now it is good and vigorous.Even before Midsummer, I do things that I couldn't do last week due to illness.",1
"Two weeks of illness, so coping with everyday card.I will be 1 about the start of the holiday.",1
"Many different emotional states.Starting in a new job has been consuming, especially when it is a bit sore at the same time.I'm 1 and I believe there is a good balance for everything.A week's work tube after a week abroad feels tough.",1
"Exhausted and auxiliary.Continuous physical fatigue and depressed feeling of despair are constantly present.I can't get things done.I forget more about my duties or avoid them, consciously exacerbating my situation.I try to find out for a day for an hour at a time from everyday life, and the day or workload of the week does not matter to fighting.Crying and feeling disappointed even though everything is still well -mental nausea and constant anxiety.",0
"The well -being has gone to the roller coaster due to the events in my immediate circle, otherwise the overall appearance has been prosperous.",1
"I've been critically pondering about my down choice for a long time.However, I have not dared to make a decision in one direction or another.This indecision and ""phasing"" will burden my mind.By the way, outside of working life, in my life, everything very well, although the career choice of a career overshadowed every day.",0
"I succeeded in the job, even though it seemed difficult (I knew I could, but it felt like a hassle).On the other hand, I do part -time work, so the job search is currently constant.The challenge is to motivate myself to apply for a job again after the last disappointment.The challenge of personal life is two losses of relationships during the spring and summer",1
"Evenly well. I have been a bit stressful about the rhythm of work, as I will soon do two jobs at the same time, one of which is independent and the other is done by the store, and I should write the final thesis. However, I have achieved peace for these things and I believe I will survive well enough. I have met a lot of new people at my friend's wedding and my partner's relatives who have been a little tense in advance, but the situations have gone well and have been a good and successful mind for a longer period of time. In addition, we went on a hiking trip for a few days, which, of course, was physically tough and nervous, but mostly promoted break -up and relaxation. In addition, various nature findings were delighted with the trip. I hate the heat and after studying the weather map of the coming week I felt a bit of anxiety. However, the general profile is relaxed and waiting. Many times in the summer, the pressure is that you should be fully in life, outdoor activities and take all the joy out of the summer, but now you are accepting. Being in the woods and spending has also been released from the world's situation, such as war, other nasty events and climate change, which often distress in everyday life.",1
"I've been doing fairly well.Sleeping has not always been successful, which has influenced coping and mood in internship.My performance in certain social situations has been bothered afterwards, but I have gone beyond them quite quickly.The difficulties thrown in front of me have not seemed completely overwhelming, and I have also gained success after coping with quite a bit of a situation I had been very afraid in advance.",1
"I have been a little stressed and longed for my time and holidays.However, I have also been really excited, inspired and experienced nice things.",1
"I have done well challenges: where to motivate the study course that doesn't interest you, where the drive to work now is much quieter than normal.Inadequate when things have not gone perfectly.1: Good collaboration with clients and colleagues who creates feelings of trust and qualifications, both that my job has value",1
There have been some challenges in my personal life that revolve around in my mind.Studying issues are also stressful.I may have slept a little too much and moved too little.,0
"My well -being has been very variable.Sometimes I think life is wonderful and everything is fine, but the same day I may still think that everything is bad and nothing can help with it.The situation is familiar and so I feel, but I don't remember experiencing this during the summer.",0
"Stress, distress, fuck.I'm sleeping badly.",0
"-I have been thinking for a long time about death and life every day -I was a couple of months ago an interesting person with whom I have spent time -the person is badly depressed and says he wants to love me, but generally does not know much of the feelings of happiness, and for example, he cried for the first time in my yearsfor me.Apparently it was a good thing -in the last two weeks this person has fulfilled my thoughts by himself and made me doubt myself that I can't believe he wants to spend time with me",0
Too hot -> exports energy action.Studies weigh on -> nothing can do -> distress.,0
"In general, I have been able to do quite well, but I have had to constantly take care of coping and balance with stress and pressure (which I put myself).So there is stress and concern, but they have stayed in control (even if I would rather be without)",0
I've been tired but still motivated to work.Relationship stories have been a bit pressed.,1
"I have been quite nervous, worried, impatient and unreasonable, which has certainly been influenced by, for example.My pet's illness and the delay of the news I expect.",0
"Exceptionally well, due to the phase of the work (final stage of one entity) and the good news related to (another) work, on the other hand, the subject of a loved one.",1
"Generally speaking, I have done well and get strength from small, everyday things.Occasionally, the amount of concerns and challenges exceeds tolerance, and I am sensitive, overreacting and tight.Usually I get over these situations well, but lately I have had the feeling that I would like to talk about my well -being with a professional.I have not received the desired help from the work psychologist.",1
"Difficulty in falling asleep, no power to do anything on the free, too much agreed stuff, also nice stuff is distressing when there are too many agreed expenses.",0
"The state of mind has been elevated.However, during the summer vacation, I have been able to take a little calmly.There has been no real restful space.Heat is difficult and takes energy",1
"I have just changed jobs and started doing sports and started to be able to be able to be great.There are communication challenges in my work, as many misunderstands my question.This is definitely normal, but I'm bored up during Korona!",1
"I've been doing well over the last two weeks.I've been quite busy, but I've also done a lot and all kinds of nice things I have been doing.Sometimes homework has been challenging because other things have become so tired.Mostly has been a great, satisfied and happy feeling.Bright and long days and warm air have maintained a 1 mood.I have seen friends, relatives and fun other, which has made a good mood.Studying, world situation (war in Ukraine), economic situation (own and general), and the health of loved ones have sometimes caused stress and concern.",1
I experienced joy and malewear when the course I proposed was approved for the curriculum and was interested in it,1
"Mostly well.Home and leisure time have gone well.There have been several challenging situations at work that have influenced my well -being, but not greatly.",1
A new job to take on bigger tasks for the first time.Gone well.New life when I've moved to a new city where I learned new things all the time.I enjoy and throw myself.,1
"The work week was heavy, but when I got on vacation, stress was easier.However, the upcoming foreign trip and the associated adjustment caused additional stress, but it is a nice trip I decided not to stress unnecessary.",0
"I've been on a summer vacation for the last few weeks since a very stressful spring.Lepo has done good, and it is nice to concentrate sometimes on your own projects without worrying about whether they will be completed on a specified schedule.",1
"Pretty badness, [Content warning suicide].The guy wants to die and I have tried to keep it alive.By the way, it's okay, except for school stuff, I did too much, the heat kills the rest of the motivation and starts with stress.So a lot of all serious here now.",0
I've been on vacation and mostly just slept out of exhaustion.,0
"I'm tired, exhausted, stressed.The reasons are both in the personal life and at work.I recently started at work and I am unsure of what is really expected of me, whether to trust that I do meaningful things independently.The work community has long been missing, there are only formally, I do telework, I find myself very lonely both professionally and otherwise.There are few friends and resources often have little to communicate.All kinds of worrying takes energy.",0
I have been doing well and got to learn new things,1
"Constantly tired.There have been too much work lately, and since I only work 3 days/week because of my studies, the pressure to work overtime is higher than usual (because there are more days a week than 3, so it's hard to appeal to not, especially in the summer).Every week I think ""this week still, and then easier"".In reality, you never make it easier.Or at least that joy won't last long.",0
Work and free time hurrying a lot,0
"For the last two weeks I've been doing just fine.Spring has been pretty tough, but the worst is behind, now we still have to work on the projects to the model that you can stay on a summer vacation.Currently, I am also a substitute for my supervisor, which brings extra pressure, but also satisfaction that I can help my supervisor to be able to trust me and leave work and take care of the holidays.",1
"The last two weeks have been quite atypical because I have mostly consumed the accumulated balance lessons, and before that I hosted the group's nice, rather familiar foreign guests.The challenges have mainly been the remembrance of events outside that program, and the fact that I cannot express myself in English as well as I would.Meeting of foreign colleagues is only aqui -way and expanding.Also, it was probably the first bigger present meeting outside your organization, and it was nice too.",0
"I haven't really got to study.I fill my day with insignificant activities, instead of seeking things that I really want.I feel the inability to start, and at times I also have difficulty concentration, although I am usually good to concentrate as long as I start.I have been able to sleep badly because I find it uncomfortable to lie in bed alone with my thoughts.I watch videos or something in bed until I fall asleep and it may take.Now two nights I have managed to fall asleep faster, and it feels good, but it has still been difficult during the day to start studying.",0
"I am stressed out of a thesis where there is even more work left than I was originally evaluated.Also, I'm afraid I've done a bad job with it.The fact that I took shifts for the summer with the thesis has been a big burden on coping and there is not enough energy for any sport, leisure activities, seeing friends or relaxing.I experience anxiety as well as my thesis and my financial situation, but I feel that I can't invest enough at the same time.A few friends meetings have been a nice break for a smooth everyday life, and one afternoon on the beach was an exception that has not been like.",0
"Mostly I have been doing well. I've been on a summer vacation that is unlikely to come in the next few years, because I'm about to graduate and when I get to work, you can just dream of such a long summer vacation. On the other hand, a long summer vacation has provided the person with the opportunity to implement hobbies that I have not been able to do during school rush or Korona. On the other hand, I have experienced anxiety that I have not had enough to do on vacation and I have been very bored on individual days. However, the holiday has made it possible to meet old friends with a quick time, which has been nice and rewarding. Despite the holiday, the challenges have been brought to life by a rather recent relationship and combining it with all other expenses. In addition, the partner's mental health issues have been concerned, even though I am not constantly worried. Menstruation of biological women's lives has also caused me to feel sick over the last two weeks. I have overcome the issues of sorrow and anxiety by talking to family, partner and friends. Discussing and dealing with one's own thoughts with others helps a lot of one's own sickness. In addition, planning things and spending brings me peace of mind and makes it easier for me. At least you should enjoy the happy moments in an instant, but remembering them brings back the good. It is definitely that I have enough to do all the time, but it may also be related to stopping to listen to the bird's song or the hum of the wind in the trees.",1
"Pressured by the Amount of Work and BeCause i've Given Responsibilites That Do Not Correspond to Me.HowEver, Recently a third party (funding agency) funded and recognized my work as Worthyt.So i feel validated by external Sources But not by my superiors.",0
"My employment contract was continued for a year just two weeks ago, so right now the mind is calm.I also went to a summer cottage where I have been able to do much more.I could actually have quite a few weeks back.",1
"I've been doing quite well over the last few weeks.Summer vacation has just begun, and it is likely that my employment will continue, which will significantly increase the mood.In the weeks before the holiday, I experienced stress because I was busy and constant at work and the tasks that caused the feeling of being alert.",1
"I have been doing well, even though my future research industry is at stake due to the difficult availability of external funding.",1
"After the year of study, I started straight summer work and even though I like my summer jobs, I feel more stressed than ever.Even in my spare time, I feel like I can't relax, the whole body is in ""tension"" all the time.I find myself constantly tired and irritable.It is anxious that as a student, the only decent holiday is a Christmas holiday, which is still half a year.",0
"I moved apart from my former spouse a month ago.Almost all recent challenges are related to the construction of a new home, a new kind of family life and financial reflection.At the same time, my own home and freedom to make decisions alone have been empowering.I feel like I'm in a good place right now",1
"I've been on vacation, so of course I've spent the best of the year.There is plenty of energy in the summer and on vacation in a completely different way than at other times.It is unfortunate to find that you are rarely alive so rarely.",1
My work is underway because there have been a lot of tragic and dramatic issues in my private life and I have fatigue physical health issues that have only begun to be treated.I would also like to have a job and better salary that corresponds to my education.Current work does not match this.,0
"Quite well.Holiday study has helped me to cope and my current job does not follow home, which is 1.",1
"On a general level badly. I am a multi -ill and problematic person. However, I may be rehabilitating back to study and working partly from partially weaker thanks to some of the caring social systems, partly. I have severe physical pain and limitations and many mental challenges that interact effectively with each other and easily cause a vicious circle that requires (and has demanded) and my own activity, but definitely also the help of professionals. My biggest challenge is that my mental and physical well -being is by no means my desire to ponder, make and influence for a better world. I am too impatient in the (also) relationship that has led to recurring overrun and the subsequent collapse. On the other hand, some kind of drop -off for years has been a great drug for critical thinking in general, because as we interact with other people, our thinking is strongly convergent. So if these reflections happen to sound like readers of your readers, it is only because I have spent a lot of time alone and guided by my own interests, so that the convergence of the opinion climate cannot happen on the same scale. For me, life is basically a bit of a bit of existential suffering, according to Buddhist and other oriental doctrines, but also impossibly interesting, which is one of the few reasons (though an important one) that still causes me to hold on to the wire.",0
"I've been mostly happy because I'm on a summer vacation and feel free.The ongoing Pride Week, which is now in progress, has brought me joy.My only concern is constantly worrying news from the world (mainly about climate change and wars), a bit of my spouse's mental nausea.",1
"I've been doing very well.I am happy and relaxed and look forward to future challenges and, for example, changes in the fall.",1
"Quite well.Some great, special experiences, lots of warmth and love, but also uncertainty about one's own place in society and the anxiety it causes.",1
"As bad as for several years.I have less than a week after years of employment.Instead, subordinates are at a steady rate weekly.I flex my own free, that even someone is there.It's stupid to ask a couple of funny weeks.This has been shit for a long time.",0
Has fucking my own field I am studying because it doesn't interest me and I can't motivate myself to do anything for it and perform all the bar and stop half of the courses or get abandoned.Living My Best Life,0
The holiday started and there are challenges to go to holiday mode and switch 24/7 with children when not in PVKOD,0
"I have done well at work and it is fun anyway.So does my children.In my spare time, the lack of relationships and sex life is annoying.The everyday life of seeing friends has also changed during the corona and many are more distant today.",1
"I have slept badly (usually less than 6h at night), done too much work and too little things I like.Work is suppressed by all the well -being and I have not been able to move or eat or have been well eaten at all.So I could have been pretty bad.",0
"Pretty bad, I feel anxious and depressed.I hate myself and believe that I have nothing.",0
"I've been doing well since I got rid of the flu.Mentally I have been doing very well.Over the last two weeks, I have had time to rest quite well, which has had a 1 effect on the mood.",1
"Currently, I have more employers and there are new jobs that make me nervous.I have participated in the entrance examinations and waiting for results are nervous.There will be 1 things in the future, but right now it is stressful.",0
"There was fatigue and load.On the other hand, the feeling is quite calm.There is interest in things.Helle has made you feel a little awkward.",1
"I feel exhaustion because my workload is higher, what I feel can.In my opinion, my social life and my leisure activities have been too little.",0
"The previous two weeks have gone to work, on Midsummer and on vacation, with more 1 events (being with friends and family) than nasty (job drama and work).On the other hand, I am a lot of anxiety about my brother's state of health, and this is the first time he is being cut.I am easily anxious if someone in my family go bad and create exaggerated horror scenarios in my mind.However, it has been fun with friends, it has felt like I can sometimes be quite social and relatively normal.All in all, I have been doing well or reasonably, but there have been some nicer moments, when for a moment the troubles have been forgotten, as well as the more sad times when the thought goes to the worse direction.",1
I've been doing very well.,1
"Over the last two weeks, I have been frustrated with the potential for healing of my prolonged depression diagnosis.My therapist is on vacation right now, so I don't get my questions or listeners at the moment.On the other hand, I have been able to communicate well in my relationship and have led to 1 things that have been delighted for the last couple of days.",0
"I have recovered well during my stay and have a lot of pleasant experiences.After returning from vacation to work, I have been relaxed and 1.Everyday life has been relaxed and the relationship has been loving and warm.",1
"Working between professions, difficult patients and rude colleagues, but also successful experiences and 1 encounters.There has been quite a lot of spending in my spare time, which is both a good thing and a bad time (recovery time).Helle has made it powerless.As a whole, moderate well -being, setbacks on its own scale were quite small.",1
"For the last two weeks I've been very happy and happy.At work, I have been responsible for challenging but interesting things.Although the situation may have been stressful at the time of this, I still feel that it was suitable for my skill level.I also got an invitation to participate in a sports project that I am both tense and excited.The weather has been great and I have been able to enjoy them with friends, which has helped to relax.",1
"The condition has fluctuated a bit because I have been ill and my work has still not progressed as expected, so I feel the pressure to get it progressing and the funding is running out.It causes anxiety, but the time spent with loved ones makes it easier.And brings a balance to life.",0
"I have done quite well because the spring pressure has slightly eased and I have been able to do summer things alongside work.A relationship is doing well, so it gives you strength to the rest of your life.",1
"Over the last two weeks, I have had an exceptionally much going on in my daily life.In order to be social on weekends at the same time as I achieve my goals (go to the gym 3 times a week, stretch, move outdoors and play trumpet) I usually work on weekdays, after which I go to the gym and do the same before going to bed.I haven't really had time to stop and relax properly.Although social appointments have been nice, they also feel like work when they have not had time to relax and jump straight to the next week.However, I am proud of myself because I know I couldn't have done more than I have done.",1
I've been doing really well!I spend my time on things that are important to me,1
It has been difficult for me to get over the divorce that happened months ago.My former partner suddenly stopped communicating and I'm really confused because I thought we had a good moment.,0
"I have depression and fatigue.Recently, everyday chores like getting out of bed and eating have been overwhelmingly difficult.Fatigue is present every day.Annoying, frustrating and annoying when I can't do things.The most 1 moments have been when I have been able to do something small, like paying bills, going to the store or cleaning up a little.Also time spent with family and friends will cheer up.",0
"I've been doing well because I have had a lot of nice things to do and friends around.Challenges have come, for example, in nightlife, where I feel harassment.",1
"Instead, I have done yard work.Full impossibility becomes oriented as school work as the kids spin around and the mother of my children does not understand much about the practical realities.The nerve is tight all the time.Fortunately, the holiday begins so you can get a graduation.",0
I've been doing very well.I have survived the challenges and enjoyed the mood when I have survived the challenging issue.,1
"I'm returning from a summer vacation to studying.Also, I'm starting short therapy.I feel rested and hopeful, but also a bit tense in the face of new challenges.I feel ready to return to everyday life, even though my resources in the spring were going to end.",1
"The work sheet has been calm and maybe even a little boring.Leisure, on the other hand, has included great experiences and encounters, I have stopped many times to feel how nice it is.",1
"I was in Korona, that is, I was abnormal.",0
"Physically better all the time, because I still wish for a month ago from the corona.However, I have been quite tired and stressed and I am not going well.I have had difficulty concentration and some tasks are distressing.I currently have too little free time because there is so much work.However, I have tried to see friends regularly and do some nice things, and horse hobby has also helped.Fortunately, for relationships, everything is fine.",0
There have been social challenges because of my impulsive behavior.I have been worried about people and my own activities and also the lack of action.I have been able to vary in different ways depending on the situation and people.,0
"I'm on annual leave and I'm doing well.The challenge is to find out about the meetings and the running of everyday life with the immediate family, as well as the tasks of their own hobbies.Everyone is self -selected and desired.I no longer do anything in my time but I really don't want to.So much I have learned so far ??",1
"Mentally well.I got work gigs for the summer, and in the fall, constantly studying in a new place will make me a happy waiting mood.Now, on vacation, I have been able to relax and do the things I enjoy: spend time with my partner and read books.There have been challenges physically and mentally.My own weight of the corona has begun to depress and distress.Now I'm about to catch myself in the neck.Obesity has mainly aroused depression, but also despair and sadness.",1
Sharing life with people has done that.It is quite a pleasure.,1
"I've been very tired.On work days, there is no energy for anything else, such as sports I would like to do or cook.However, on holidays, I have enjoyed life after spending time with friends and sleeping for a long time without working stress.All in all, I find myself longing for a vacation, but summer goes to work and then continues my studies.",0
"I have been on vacation and was better than if this survey had been done before in the last couple of years. There have been hardly any challenges on vacation, except trying to keep the sleep pattern smart and then learn how to use contact lenses as a new thing. Learning the lens loaded in the spring, but now it was a success and happy feeling enough to recover from the body stress. I have also seen friends more often for a long time, with fewer opportunities during pandemic. It has become a communal fluffy feeling, it feels like a Caberical caring and happiness. I've been happy with the new home and cultivation box. Sometimes it has been a bit annoying to see the travel pictures of others in somewhere that there is no seam now. But the boyfriend has been romantically happy and for the rest of the week we go to the island, which is something I dream of in the winter, so I have been juicing on that dream of dreaming and happy. I have supported my friends if they want to break their mind and feel good to be better than stressful to make it possible to be more supportive for others.",1
"I may have been pretty bad, I have had a lot of stress and setbacks about my studies.These also cause uncertainty about the future.At the same time, I have to work for work pressure even though I am on annual leave.I have found myself very annoyed, sad and very crying.It often feels like I do not recognize myself.In the past I was really 1 and happy now I feel like being fragile and sad",0
"In my spare time in my personal life, I have experienced inadequacy as a talker in the roles: a friend, a boyfriend, a child and a colleague.Speech communication tangles, no intoxicants are in use.The challenges have been the observation of the thunderstorms, including violence videos, lack of sex, loneliness, anxiety.1 experiences of emotional life with a partner, exercise, outdoor activities, entertainment programs.",0
"Tired, I am inexperienced in challenging work and the supervisor gives more responsibility instead of support.I'm frustrated, tired, but also amused about the situation.",0
Very well,1
"The challenges of recent weeks have been more about home front, my husband and my relationship.We have been a bit like a crossroads after more than 25 years of cohabitation and now decided to continue the same path.However, the decision is not easy and it has burdened my summer vacation.",0
"I find myself more irritable again and when I wake up in the morning, the first feeling is a fucking.I know it is because this summer I have to do a full-time week instead of part-time.And more evening shifts, so there is no time for work and sleep a day.I have been to the gym in the evenings because I can't do it by the way, but then it affects the quality of the night's sleep, but it is worth it anyway.",0
"Sometimes I experience anxiety (head and breast squeezing) from my studies.My third year at the university has ended and I still have courses.I feel bad about this because the planned bachelor's stage is three years.I have a mild dyslexia and sometimes I feel that my concentration is getting worse.One teacher has advised and explained that stretching of studies is quite normal.Sometimes I think everything is fine and I do not value myself based on credits.Often, however, I feel that I have failed and I am very afraid of future studies.However, talking to the closest ones makes it easier to dismantle the mind -breaking thoughts.Otherwise, they will swell insurmountable.I often wonder how grateful I am of my closest.",0
"1 things in relationships, 0 in their own inaccessibility and jerking",0
"I've been doing just fine.Because of the summer jobs, the rhythm of everyday life has changed slightly, but in the fall it is nice to go back to studies.",1
"Tired, exhausted but happy.",0
"The last two weeks include a relatively large change of life, which, however, has been known, 1 and expected.The change has brought additional stress, but since close relationships have worked and I have been treated even in the hurry, I feel that, except for individual moments, I have also done very well (meaning that my mood has remained optimistic and calm despite the back packages).",1
"Slight work -based performance pressures on schedule and demanding tasks, but in a way I am quite relaxed with them.I have survived the tasks well and have slightly exceeded my expectations.I have also found that I have a knowledge, which has previously been a little uncertain about the adequacy.It became a nice feeling.",1
"I've been doing really well in recent days. I was my whole short holiday, that is, last week, to my annoyance in pneumonia, but I still got the spiritual rest I needed, and now in July, when the office has no need for my work and all courses have been completed, I finally have time to focus on writing my diploma work. It feels nice that you don't have to stretch to two or three places, but you can focus on one thing without having the idea of ??what else to do in the background. Although I have set a really tight schedule for myself, which was further tightened with two weeks of illness, but stress has not yet hit, and I feel that I work best under pressure. The challenge is that I do not have ADHD medication, even if I benefit especially in writing (queues at FSHS were 4 months old). However, it has not had a significant impact on my mood because I am with you and my challenges. I have also had more time out for outdoor activities and it has calmed my restless mind. One of the most important problems that have been overlooking for months is the life situation of my spouse. His studies have not progressed, he does not receive study grants (the months of support ended due to a previous interrupted degree), he has not been applied for, and has not applied for help, his money is out and he does not receive livelihoods because of Kela (but not law) I should support him because we live together. This has caused me a lot of stress, and also guilt because I have not been able to support him in the right way. Yesterday, however, he sent his first job application and made me feel really relieved and satisfied. However, there was the fear that I did not maintain the level of my colleagues in the standard of living because I have chosen a spouse who can barely support himself. In addition, the situation arouses anger about his multi -problem parents, primary school teachers and society as a whole, while current politics, on the one hand, pursues together due to high cost of living, and, on the other hand, punishes the couple's worse acting party in the form of lower support.",1
"Stress, in a responsible job that I do not feel qualified but I guess it all the time is learned",0
I have encountered a few setbacks in a bigger project that has been in the mood.,0
"Tired, stressed, in the background of knowing that I should do a good thesis but I just can't handle.Work situation confusing, stress too.I sleep badly, I don't fall asleep without medication.The heat makes you feel crazy.A happy child and swimming pool is good, the feel of the cool water on the skin rinses out worries.Coffee and dismantling with the brother's wife is also good.It empties the head and stops at the point of thought.The journey to Estonia was lovely-- lots of beautiful scenery, the sea shore and good food, but it was strenuous.The heel is sore, it takes joy from everything that involves moving.I try to cover it from others because it would need rest to heal and there is no time right now.I always think about others and their needs.I can't let go.The future scares.",0
"I've been on vacation in Italy so I've experienced new nice things, some physical strain and stress caused by travel.Mainly I have been happy and happy.",1
"I have done quite well, although I have recently focused on the themes of eco -disaster and fossil capitalism in my studies just last two weeks and have been more and more convinced of the perikato.Although I have been doing these studies for several years, so this is not a new thing, but I am studying more, so I think more.Contrary to what could be inferred from this, I have not been depressed in any way, etc., because I have already dealt with this over the past few years.But the constant reading of heavy scientific research is, of course, the most heavily possible subject to a long time for a long time.Conclusion: I could have been better than these Specs you might think you can.",1
Relaxed because I've been on vacation almost every day.,1
"The last two weeks have been special because I have experienced a bunch of challenges in one week and another more relaxed life.The week before I got bad news about an important person's state of health, which was really stressful and distressing.At the same time, there was a really challenging and difficult course where I did not receive the support I needed and were quite alone with the challenges, which further increased stress levels.Fortunately, however, the course is now in the package, which significantly relieved stress levels and facilitated the state.",1
"stressed, tired of the little one, I didn't get just about anything",0
It is time to get the challenges to work.The emotional state is anxious and uncertain due to a health problem.,0
"I have had to step outside my comfort zone during my studies and work.This has caused stress and made me feel anxiety and anxiety.But for the most part I have done well and I have had time for myself and my friends, which has helped keep stress under control.",0
"I have been doing well because I start my doctoral dissertation studies I've been dreaming of for a long time.Summer and sun also have a 1 effect on my mood.However, challenges are my financial situation because I have no funding yet and I get a really bad salary for my current job.The world political situation and climate change are also worrying.",1
"Stressed, irritated, tired, crying sensitive",0
I have been tired of my job and wondered how and when to resign.,0
"In the last two weeks I have been able to vary.I've been both happy, happy and enthusiastic and depressed, restless, skeptical and tired.I have not got the right or continued things that seem too challenging and that are urgent and where the probabilities of success seem to be reduced over time.So I feel stuck.",0
"Pretty bad.Has tried to holiday without being able to calm down, relax and refresh properly.Lost time on the wrong things.",0
"I have been on vacation and have done things I like, that is, very well, but workplace tensions have even plagued every day",1
