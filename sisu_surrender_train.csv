"If I knew this, I probably wouldn't be in the academic industry and would be seeking a plain.Disclosure came to mind, but I haven't found any options yet.And I probably let my coping zero before I can give up.",0
"I believe that at that point when achieving a goal causes cross -border crossing and feeling unwell, and achieving the goal would mean neglecting many things and one's own life.Then you should continue if your goal seems to be clear, and you can trust that it will bring more well -being to yourself.",1
"The mental capacity is affected if a person is, for example, being handed over.",1
"It is worth giving up when the goal or goal no longer seems worth all of it or the benefits of achieving the goal is significantly lower than should be in relation to the workload or the sacrifices made therefore.The decision to give up is influenced by the resources currently in use, the number and importance of other issues currently in progress, as well as the resources required for them and the significance of the objective and the amount of the benefit of it.",1
The significance and end of the matter.Does it have a great importance in the future or can it be possible.,1
My own intuition that surrender is necessary for your own well -being and then feel better,1
No idea.,0

You can't really know it.Sometimes it is worthwhile to make a bend in order to reach the goal sometimes it is worth changing your goal.It's a good idea to choose your battle.,0
"If the pursuit is so heavy that it is no longer worth reaching the goal, I would give up.",1
"It may be worth giving up when you have been trying for a while and not successful, including any help.When the rest of life suffers considerably and/or for a long time.It is harder to give up a stubborn head.",1
"If the goal is completely unrealistic, you should give up.",1
It is a good idea to give up when you feel your own mental and/or physical resources to be over.It is a good idea to continue your goal if your goal still feels meaningful and realistic to you.The extradition decision is influenced by the time and energy used to achieve the goal and the probability of taking the project.To the finish.,1
They don't know.Disclosure/continuation is more about a personality than at rational reflection.The amount of sinking costs makes it more difficult for everyone to surrender.,0
"It is a good idea to give up if the pursuit of a goal is to endanger safety, economy, mental health or an important relationship.Continuing is motivated by the experience of success and rewards such as money.",1
"The main thing is what you want to see.Every person varies greatly based on, for example, their own values and previous experiences.",1
"It is a good idea to give up if the fatigue/sickness/interpersonal problems arising from the pursuit are greater than what the feeling of success, reward, etc. can be reached.",1
It makes sense to surrender when the resources are over.,1
"When you are no longer mentally or physically, even though it's too late for well -being.",1
"Good question.I gave up my previous work because of the constant stress, sleep difficulties and feeling sick.I decided to quit, even though I basically liked the work and its challenges, but with the man I came to the conclusion that not at the expense of health.However, I do not feel this from surrender, although it may seem like it, but the only sensible option in a situation where the employer does not give any other options.",1
It seems that many decide to give up because they are tired.,1
"If there is no loss or no worse situation, it is not worth giving up",1
"I have been influenced by how much I want that thing.Because if I want something really much, I don't easily give up.I feel that I and many will surely have that hopelessness and when it lasts long enough, it may feel that you can no longer and give up.I also have influenced the goal of pursuing the goal of how likely and logical I have for me that if achieved it is originally unlikely I usually give up quickly",1
When resources are no longer enough to try.,1
"It is not worth pursuing an impossible person, if you realize it is impossible to give it up.On the other hand, if the opportunities are open and very much wants, you should try.",1
Listen to the heart.,0

"My well -being.If the pursuit goes ahead, it would be a good time to give up, or at least take a break.I am aware of, but not always realized.",1
"Yeah, I don't think there is one answer to this.It depends on the person and the matter what the goal is and what should be done at that moment and what the consequences have.The life of the other is rescued by artificial respiration for longer (until the emergency care is present, then it took a moment or long) to find out alone how the child would be sewn into a joke, or when he is handed over and called the mother -in -law to sew it.",0
Then when you no longer handle when you have everything if you have done,1
"People do not always know it, and sometimes it can be difficult to make a decision to give up.On the other hand, it is sometimes difficult to evaluate whether it is profitable to pursue a goal.In many cases, it is profitable if one can develop himself or do good things.If, on the other hand, the pursuit of a goal threatens to eat all the resources and rather causes only evil (eg stress or relationships of relationships) to stop to think about what or whom it is aimed at.",0
As hopeless work has continued longer than the benefit of the work.,1
"As I set the goal, I try to think about whether it is worth the pursuit, my time and my energy.If I later find that there is not enough value, I can give up.",1
"At the latest, you know when to give up when the body reacts with, for example, insomnia.It is worthwhile to continue when you have a good flow and feel empowered.The decision to give up is influenced by well -being and prioritization of things that are important to you.",1
Depends on the subject.If you have already really tried enough and can judge the situation as crossing your own abilities.Usually people give up too easily.,1
In certain/some things but I'm better.I do not easily give up on these things.,1

"Disclosure for my decision is strongly influenced by the failed repetitions, my feelings, and the opinion of the loved ones.However, I try to learn more about listening to myself than to believe my loved ones, and to distinguish when my opinion is more right and worth choosing for me.",1
"Some do not seem to understand that it is worth giving up at a certain point, some give too easily.So the answer: I don't know.The idea of ""meeting difficult facts"" has become important to me, followed by changes accordingly.",1
"Continue to the family endlessly.The shame of surrender can prevent trust, but I do not experience one myself.You have to understand your own boundaries.",1
"As long as the goal feels worth pursuing, you have to go, but at the same time you have to be able to be constantly critical of it and assess whether it is still meaningful and worthy of things as you progress, or have the experience brought something that shows that the goal needs to be editedOr change the direction of action.Also, the experience of seeking something more negative in the life of yourself and the environment shows that the goal needs to be examined and assessed whether the disadvantage is still lower than the experience of achieving the goal.At the same time, one must also be able to evaluate whether the pace on which it is moving towards the goal, right, or whether to slow down for a moment, stop or act more effectively.",1
I rarely give up something.Often the decision is due to the fact that one's own mental or physical resources are not enough in that situation.When the situation allows I always strive to reach the goal,1
"It is a good idea to give up the goal if it is not personally liked, causing nausea in itself or in the environment, and deviates from the inner desire.It is worthwhile to continue when you feel an important and essential part of your own desire to create satisfaction and will.The decision is influenced by the individual's resources and motivation, as well as mental pressure tolerance.",1
Not to sleep,0
"We need to weigh the burden of one's own resources and the importance of the goal in a larger picture.You have to remember to take care of your own well -being, unfortunately this is often easy to forget.",1
Things that do not change the likelihood of reaching a larger goal can be forgotten,1
"Personally, I find out my thoughts by talking to other people or writing myself.Reading different perspectives helps.",1
"The first question is my mystery too. I think quite a lot is about the personality, how long and performance -oriented is. By performance -oriented, I mean that if, for example, you are used to the fact that most of the time things are done as long as you try enough, it is likely that you will try to try more than once in the face of things. Here, of course, people are not equal, some have more experiences of success than others and more enablers in the way of success. At least the motivation is probably influenced by the decision to give up, that is, how important the goal is for man. A young aspirant who wants to act as an actor may not stop applying until the age limit comes. On the other hand, in the case of a more everyday goal, for example, the dishwashing dishes several times a week because the dish lining is sometimes irritated, the motivation may be much weaker and it is easier to give up (if the skeleton is not a passion). The goal may be more easily discouraged. In addition, the character and life experience I mentioned in the first answer.",1
"Comparison with previous similar experiences and belief in one's own abilities, in my opinion, influence how long it is possible to try.The comments of others can also affect their own decision, as sometimes they may not believe they will do well, but the faith and encouragement of others still make it try.Or, on the contrary, someone can stubbornly continue to try, even though the related party realizes that it is not profitable, and then a comment to a loved one may help to better understand the situation.In addition, thoughts always revolve around entrepreneurship or donation in the weighing of any disadvantages or benefits, and when the potential benefits of either option are bigger than the disadvantages, this option is selected.",1
"I don't think it can often be known for sure.The decision to surrender is certainly influenced by its own resources such as time, the importance of the goal, the support or pressure obtained from the environment, the personality of the person and the consequences of the transfer or goal achievement.",1
Is it a goal of your own values and does it give more to what to take.The decision to surrender is influenced by: your own mental and physical well -being,1
"Perhaps you can't try anymore.If the goal no longer seems worth pursuing and painful.Time, coping, motivation.",1
"I guess you can't always say it for sure.But I believe that it is influenced by, for example.Previous experiences of success or failure, and through it, whether you believe in achieving your goal or whether you just think you fail.",1
"The decision to surrender is influenced by the exhaustion of continuation, and the reward seems too small to be to be pursued.",1
"One has to think about what is the efficiency of the matter, whether or not to give more than giving.On the other hand, there are things that cannot only be thought of, for example, promoting one's own values does not necessarily bring material benefit but to give mentally.",1
I do not know.,0
"Donation is most affected by how high the risk is in relation to the victory, the so -called.High Risk - High Reward.In my opinion, surrender goes according to each person, and there are no clear boundaries or rules for the decision to surrender.",1
It is a good idea to give up if there is no realistic route or implementation.Continuing is worthwhile if it is realistic.,1
"I guess in the current working life, many do not know and drive themselves to the end.However, there could be ways to know: listening to your body, talking about feedback, talking to others about the task.The ""donation"" decision is certainly influenced by a person's personality, the performance models that have been learned, or whether it is self -esteem to be done.",1
"If the goal is important to you and you should continue your own value.If the continuation of ""endangering"" themselves or loved ones may not be worth continuing",1
"The importance of the goal will probably have an impact.On the other hand, the individual's own characteristics and resources, ""conscience"", determination, a tendency to positive or negative thinking, etc. are sure to affect.",1
"I don't know, neither on my own nor for others.In its own right, the decision to give up is influenced by exhaustion and/or the fear of disappointment or even more difficult feelings.",0
"Must listen to the inner sound and mirror them to opportunities (resources, efficiency, etc.)",1
"You know it inside.Resources, stress levels, community support, external pressure, other things on a plate",1
The state of mind is a decisive factor.,1
"You can't know it.Sometimes goals are achieved by chance.For me, the decision is mainly influenced by discouragement.Another encouragement can make you continue.",0
"The realism and importance of the goal are probably the most influential factors.The more realistic and important the goal is, the more likely it is to continue the goal.Of course, your own mental and physical resources, as well as life situations and circumstances, also have a significant impact.They significantly determine the possibilities for achieving a goal.",1
"Of course, my own values are largely guided, as well as other people.We need to weigh what is most important.If you are aiming for a goal that is not central to yourself, it is easier to give up so -called.on cue.Age and experience also bring perspective.",1
"When the replacement goal is more to be sought, that will probably be easily abandoned from the early part of the early one ...",1
The pursuit of goals is important and when the pursuit is possible and it is advancing.If the pursuit takes more than it gives and it may not make sense to give up on a case -by -case basis.,1
"Self -awareness, self -esteem, perseverance, own resources, support of others",1
"I can't say, really bad to evaluate what is worth going on and when to give up.Learned method, usually I will continue too much even if I might have given up.",0
"When achieving a goal is impossible or the disadvantage of it is greater than the benefit.It is worthwhile if you are looking for your own accessible dream or if your achievement brings great benefit to yourself, others or society.The decision to give up is influenced by all the things that are currently in progress, depending on the situation, differently.",1
"If you do not detect progress, it is difficult to continue.Concrete results motivate.",1
"I can't say just a few things, I think all the decisions depend on many things, such as the person and his or her values and the nature of the situation.In addition, often external opinions affect decisions",0
"People know nothing about anything, the pressure to perform may help to continue even if survival does not cause a sense of relief.The extradition will then happen if otherwise breaks too much.Sometimes I still have given up on time and experienced relief.The softness of the environment and the opportunity to try to re -try to give up.",1
"Therefore, when this is not important, it is not worth sacrificing.If the goal is not realistically available, it is not advisable to continue.",1
"It is a good idea to continue as long as the matter is mitigating for yourself and believes that achieving a goal is possible.For example, it is worth giving up if the pursuit of this is too much interfering with other life.",1
Use of time and how to affect your loved ones and the environment,1
"Not the slightest observation.At least I can't leave anything in time.If I give up, then it will happen before it has even started, or it only happens in extreme distress when there are no other options.",1
If other things in the horizontal cup weigh more.,1
"People, or me?A strangely designed question, I don't know about ""people"" thinking more than others.If resources are simply not enough and it is not worthwhile to continue, you should give up.The decision is influenced by one's own coping, enthusiasm and the possible reward of the project.",1
It is worth giving up when it is not relevant to yourself and it causes anger or negative consequences.,1
"How do I know what others know about it ... probably will be handed over after a few attempts if things don't seem to progress at all.On the other hand, there are things and things.If it is really important, like ""rescuing the world"", it is worthwhile to continue to pursue even when there is no hope.Then they are only given up when either cynical or anxious - mental health goes.",1
"It's a good idea to continue if the pursuit itself brings some value, such as learning.Or if you are looking for something, even if you do not reach the final goal.It is a good idea to give up if you start to find the pursuit unpleasant or discouraging, or you will find that the target is unsuitable for yourself.",1
"I feel that I can quite well evaluate what can be achieved if I don't think something is, I don't usually start it.However, if I realistically estimates that something will not work, even if I try to give up.",1
"If your own resources are not enough to reach your goal and it is not possible to make it easier to achieve it by asking for help from someone else, then you should be able to give up. However, it also depends on the goal and its importance to yourself/others. There are negative feelings about the issue of surrender, such as intense stress, and it evokes unpleasant or sad feelings, which affects the decision to see if it can continue to do so. Other symptoms of nausea, such as insomnia and distracting, or the observations of others or self -made, or self -mood or external state (eg, fatigue, etc.) may affect the decision to surrender. However, the decision will certainly be influenced by the importance and importance of the goal for yourself or for others, such as your own family. On the other hand, it is also easy to compare it to your performance/activities with other people, so you can set your own well -being on a ""scale"" and decide whether it makes sense to surrender or continue. Support or lack thereof may also affect the decision to give up.",1
By their Limits and Past Experiences,0
"I think of the benefits.If the pursuit, or process, is more harmful than good, I give up.",1
"I do not believe that people always know in advance when it comes to giving up or continuing to do something.I think that when making the decision, people evaluate the importance of themselves and others, as well as their own resources, their work/life situation and future prospects.My own values and beliefs influence the background, even if they are not actively considered.",1
Then it is only worth giving up if you have been seeking the matter for many years without realizing it.It is often worth trying time and time again.,1
"At least in my own case, the opinions of loved ones and whether the support of loved ones is available.",1
It is worth giving up once you have tried at least once or a couple of after stating that the goal is not going at all and should be handed over.,1
"In fact, I have got at least Burn Out at work because of unnecessary.The work I did was not worth losing health.If the goal can be justified for yourself and find it important to achieve it, it is ok to continue to pursue it.",1
One has to think about what values influence the pursuit of a goal.Are the values okay?Is this something that is why I will be happy with my life later?Is this worth it?,1
"By the time you have tried many times and always failed, it is worth giving up",1
"My answer is: often do not know (including myself). I have not yet found the balance of the ""Explore vs. Exploit [Option Space]"" mechanism in life. After all, the answer to this problem has been found in Computer Science, as long as certain background parameters have received values. The problem with its application to the real world is that we do not understand the world of chaotic surrounding the world well enough to get clear values ??for the background parameters and thus reduce the problem into a mechanically solving mathematical equation. However, I myself may at least have been heavily more in favor of the average and in-depth experiment and reflection process I have expected, both in the right direction of the environment and for the individual himself in the right direction. In other words, I often feel that society somehow manages to grow people from people: to do it effectively - but potentially the wrong things. Like many other things in life, I think it is actually a systemic problem by accident. On the other hand, analysis paralysis is also the right problem. In front of too many options, it easily drifts into a state of indecision. But is it necessarily a bad thing? If we focus too much on doing the direction at the expense of the direction of choosing, as I think we do now, humanity will find itself at an accelerating pace towards the wall. It is now well seen in, for example, over -use of planetary resources, on the one hand, under under -working under the coronavirus or even a solar storm for catastrophic risks. So we play imminent and poor with our lives and more widely throughout the biosphere. At one time, I learned the principle that studying the boundaries of matters often gives you something essential about their nature. So: if we have an alternative to focus solely on doing and not to consider the direction at all, we really drive at something - but probably in the wrong - direction, because at some level it can be argued that mistake is very often easier/more likely than success. If, on the other hand, we just think about things, but not doing anything, we won't go anywhere. In my opinion, it is a better option, considering the amount of the risk of error and the cost it causes. In a more mathematically expressed fully, concentration of doing is, in my opinion, a negative expectation value, while pondering it is at least close to neutral - so just thinking about these extreme cases is a less bad option. Of course, it is different how this ""utility function"" behaves between extreme cases. In my opinion, there is no reason to assume that it is linear between the boundary conditions. Still a bit of the last question: I think primarily emotions, even though society appreciates rationality (well too much in my opinion). However, according to research, man is primarily an emotional and then rational being. In particular, Western philosophy and culture, in particular, often fail in this grain perception of the core of humanity: it often pushes the human -guided person into a mold of rationality, which loses a deeper understanding of the reference framework where people act, think and know.",0
"If something is really important to yourself, because of your ideological or personal morals or values, then this will continue and will not give up until it is fully beaten.the meaning of the case affects the decision to surrender",1
Conscientiousness and determination.Previous experiences and self -knowledge and education.Demolition when it comes to giving up and when to continue to continue a truly blurred line drawn in the water.,1
"Everyone in mind makes evaluation of their own resources, the importance of reaching the goal of how much surrender affects the future.The decision to give up arises when a person states that he has given the goal more time and other effort when he or she was originally thought.",1
"Emotions, ""gut-feeling"", values and expectations.Probably it varies in different situations and between people.I have realized that people would generally be most satisfied with the decisions, even in the long term, which, in the decision -making situation, ""felt right"" and not just seem sensible.",1

When the time begins to go unreasonably to achieve the goal no longer makes sense to continue.Or if the goal is no longer timely.,1
"It is worth giving up when the overall picture takes into account the goal is to take more than to give.For example, if the pursuit of a new job can endanger a relationship that is important to yourself, you need to weigh which is more important to you.Things that affect the decision to surrender vary according to matters that affect the goal: what you get or have to give up",1
No one wants to give up but emotions lead us,0
"Influence how important the goal is.For example, if the goal is vital for a career, then the extradition will not happen as easily as, for example, a game.If the goal is important enough, surrender is not an option.",1
"In my opinion, giving up a goal does not necessarily mean surrender as a negative thing.It can often be great wisdom.I believe that the decision is very personal and every person knows best when it is good to give up.One meter is whether pursuing the goal brings more than it takes?",1
"If something produces good feelings and worth pursuing, then the pursuit will continue.The extradition is influenced by seeing different operating models, the more options for doing something, the easier it is to choose a possible operating model.",1
"When the pursuit of this takes more life than what it could bring, it is worth giving up.Or if the pursuit makes life unfortunate.If this is important and the pursuit does not unduly make other objectives complicate, you can continue.",1
"When your own resources are already running out and it is more harmful than beneficial to complete it, it is a good idea to stop.",1
"It is certainly not known, depending on the nature of a person, the temperamental traits and the previous experiences of how a person decides to act.Everyone will probably make a invoice decision in their head, where the losses caused by the continuation exceed any profits.Certainly self -esteem will also affect it as well as self -awareness.",0
"When the desirable thing begins to feel smaller than the time and ailment seen in it, it is worth giving up on its pursuit.",1
"I think that if the goal is in line with your own important values, it is not worth giving up on it, but if your condition deteriorates, you should re -evaluate how and at what pace you could go towards the goal.",1
It is a good idea to continue when the goal is important or the consequence of surrender is a major disadvantage.The evaluation of these must be constantly done and compared to how much effort it takes to do the matter.,1
"Not all people know, many trouble so -called.The illusion of sunken costs (continuing to pursue regardless of its realism, since the issue has previously consumed a lot of resources).Often the extradition is done too late (eg in relationships, in a project that has been drifted to the wrong career) and the ""right"" delivery point can only be seen later, further away.The decision to surrender is influenced by the likelihood of reaching the target, the resources available, the risks, the alternative costs, etc.",1

"If this is really important, you want it more than anything else and you are ready to endure waiting and working on it, you should continue to pursue it.On the other hand, it is also good to map the options.A good rule of thumb is that everything can be achieved, but not at the same time.Prioritization is essential in order to have enough resources to reach the most important things.However, with less relevant things, you should go from where the fence is lower.",1
"My own values and commitment feels good and important to try to achieve.The circumstances do not always give it a chance and then have to weigh between different values, such as one's own coping and work target.",1

"Ten dawn question.I can't answer in general.For me, driving for myself is the realization of my own values and their life.But often just stubbornness.I give up when I cannot believe I can achieve the goal I want, or when I see that the necessary means are not ethical in harmony with goals.",0
"Income and Expenditure evaluation and long -term planning.The clear unprofitability of the task from different angles, from different angles, contributes to the lack of the motivation needed and abandoned the challenge.",1
"I don't know, sometimes it feels like it's hard to even know when to give up and when not. I myself have a bit of a whimpering principle of what is worth pursuing, I focus too much on, for example, grades. But the big lines are still in order. I cannot speak for others, but in principle my own activities are guided by the following principles: -In society and home -learned values ??set what is to be desirable. Education, health, good fitness, civilization, family, independence. These affect my choices. -It's goals are a lot related to the fact that I can live in the place I want and spend the time I want, with the people I want. -The activity that helps you get closer to the goal should continue even when it is not nice. -The activity that is fun can continue reasonably even when it does not take you to the target / home values. -The donation is worthwhile when the activity is not fun and does not take you to goals. -It is still the continuation of the action. In this case, it is important for self -esteem and self -empowerment experience. -If it is unlikely to reach the goal, it is worth giving up, unless it is such an important thing that you will not try to not try on your death bed. -The decision to donate is also influenced by the opinions of others, for me only to the extent that they bring more perspectives through the reasoning.",0
If the goal is not worth the trip,0
"Everyone probably has a varying degrees of threshold for surrender, but also for what they define in order to give up. If the first -tried approach does not lead to the desired result - is it a change of operation, even if it achieves the original goal? Some are endlessly persevered and continue towards their goals, while the other or two, after trying, leave it. The benefit of the purpose and the amount of work required to achieve it in relation to the resources used by the person's use are probably also influenced by the transfer and continuation of the goal. For example, is it absolutely important to get a leading place to study and how much time and other resources are available for it. And would the pickle jar open faster if you asked for any other help? Perhaps people will give it easier if the benefit of the goal does not, in their view, correspond to the investment required to achieve it. In bigger and even life -impact issues, people are often more persistent and work more for it. Probably a few have started to go to the gym to open the throat jars, but even more years can be worked on.",1
"The decision is influenced by personal values, qualities and experiences.Information about when to give up or continue depending on the individual, and in the end they are not known as the individual himself.",1
"I only give up when I feel I can't do anything/find new solutions anymore.Often it leads to spending a lot of time on things and getting them often solved, but since there are even more new tasks, it means that I always have too much work.",1
"Miss other people has some kind of instinct or feeling that tells when the border comes up.For me it doesn't work.I effort until I am exhaust and I can no longer.I try to justify myself with reason why it would be worth giving up or moving the goal, but if it fails, I will not take the reasons for myself.",1
"Fear, uncertainty, failure, the benefit of success does not exceed the disadvantage of failure",1
"Not about anything other than their own nature, mainly. Of course, it depends on the situation of life. If you are young, discouraging parents, etc. can quarrel to give up. As a parent, many people can't even try. However, nowadays, it is not recognized, but still belittles the fact that in the upcoming modern society, which is about to end our lives, more and more decisions are actively guided by what is worth trying to seek at all. Even my previous answer is still in line with hegemonic individualistic ideology. Why, however, seek some great goal of the whole life, when it seems very likely, given the scientific facts alone, that the downhill of civilization as a whole has not begun and will only accelerate in the coming decades? That is, another answer to the question: People know when to give up when they have read enough about what's to come. In this case, the answer is ""immediately"".",1
"People do not know, but do these types of things based on their feelings.",0
"I guess it's some kind of intuition that either guides you to continue or give up.Many things are certainly influenced by the decision to give up, depending on the goal.For example, whether the goal pursuit is still economically viable or possible (like some really difficult field of study).",1

A difficult question.When should you give up?Then if it seems that you have given everything and your goal has become more obsessed than the real benefit.,0
"At least it depends on the importance of the goal for yourself and others, the urgency of the goal and the likelihood of achieving the goal.Sometimes it is advisable to continue pursuing a goal even when the likelihood of failure is very high.The decision to give up is often very much influenced by how capable people believe in reaching the goal and how much you are afraid of failure.",1
"An estimate of whether you get a bigger benefit than the work you need to do.Is the goal worthy of all work.It is influenced by one's own values (does the goal serve a larger entity for yourself) the social environment (who else wants the goal) and how well the person feels (recognizing their own resources, is it enough)",1
