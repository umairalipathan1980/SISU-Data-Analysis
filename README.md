# SISU-Data-Analysis
Analysis of SISU data. 
1. Clustering of Feelings and Surrender columns (UMAP + HDBSCAN, AgglomerativeClustering with BERT, K-means clustering)  
2. SENTIMENT PREDICTION FOR 'FEELING' AND 'SURRENDER' RESPONSE BY LABELING THE 'FEELING' AND 'SURRENDER' COLUMNS AND FINE-TUNING THE HUGGING FACE TRANSFORMER MODEL  
3. Imputing missing values before building a regression model. Evaluating zero imputing, KNN score, mean and iterative   
imputing.  
4. MULTI-TARGET REGRESSION EXCLUDING THE TEXT COLUMNS (FEELINGS, SURRENDER)  
5. MULTI-TARGET REGRESSION WITH FEELINGS AND SURRENDER COLUMNS. THESE TWO COLUMNS HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO CATEGORIAL   
FEATURES.
